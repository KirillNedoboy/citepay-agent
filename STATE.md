## Product

AgentPay Guard - preflight policy and audit layer for AI-agent payments.

New Lepton/CitePay direction: CitePay Agent builds on AgentPay Guard as an AI paid-citation product where an agent selects paid creator/source content, turns each selection into a payment intent, and evaluates it through the existing Guard API before any payment rail is used.

## Not done

- GitHub repo publication.

## Current product boundary

The MVP evaluates payment intent before payment execution.

It must not move real funds.

The CitePay direction must not remove or weaken the existing AgentPay Guard MVP boundary. CitePay may prepare payment intents for evaluation, but it must not execute real payments.

## Target demo

A local web demo where the user can run:

1. API nanopayment -> `ALLOW`.
2. Machine-to-machine telemetry payment -> `REVIEW`.
3. Risky autonomous payment -> `BLOCK`.

Each result must create an audit log record.

## Next safe implementation phase

Review the updated CitePay public narrative and screenshot-backed proof-pack docs before publication.

This phase should remain local and deterministic. It should not add live payment execution, wallet signing, custody, private key handling, DB/auth, or smart contracts.

## Deadline target

Builder proof should be ready by 2026-05-31.

## Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Scope creep into live payments | Keep live Circle/x402 integration as roadmap unless explicitly requested. |
| Fake compliance claims | Use "policy/audit layer", not AML/KYC/fraud guarantee. |
| Weak demo | Ensure 3 scenarios are visible and audit log is generated. |
| Missing visual proof | Capture actual screenshots before publishing; do not use placeholders. |
| Codex context drift | Keep `AGENTS.md`, `STATE.md`, `SESSION_NOTES.md` updated. |
| CitePay scope creep | Keep CitePay as source selection plus Guard evaluation until live payments are explicitly requested. |
| Ecosystem overclaiming | Do not claim official Circle, Arc, x402, Lepton, grant, user, revenue, or traction status. |
