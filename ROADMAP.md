- denylist;
- velocity rules.

### Milestone 3 - Webhook/audit export

Add:

- webhook on decision;
- CSV/JSON export;
- audit hash chain or Merkle-style digest.

### Milestone 4 - Team/operator flow

Add:

- review queue;
- manual approval/deny;
- reviewer notes;
- decision history.

### Milestone 5 - Production hardening

Add:

- DB-backed audit log;
- auth;
- rate limiting;
- observability;
- proper deployment config;
- integration tests.

## Not on MVP roadmap

- AML/KYC provider features;
- custody;
- wallet private-key handling;

- fake transaction hashes;
- smart contracts unless a specific audit anchoring requirement appears.
